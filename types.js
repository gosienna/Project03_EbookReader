// The 'Book' interface is for type definition only and does not translate to runtime JavaScript code.
// No content change needed for this file as it only defines an interface.
// For JavaScript, you would define an object shape implicitly through usage or with JSDoc.
// Since it's a type-only file, it's effectively empty in JS.
